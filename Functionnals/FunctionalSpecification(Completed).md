| Term used | Definition |
|---|---|
| "Simulator" | Software that recreate the reality |
| "Tanks" | Armored vehicules, usualy mounted with a cannon and have tracks other than wheels |
| "Engine" | An engine, for game developping, provides the physic, audio, visuals and game management for a game |

<h3 id="2_Project-Information">2) Poject information</h3>

<h4 id="Project-Overview">Project overview</h4>

The goal of this project is to make a tank simulator. The principle of it is to have the maximum immersion possible,while having every details that can be added to create a real simulator. It will be for everyone so classified documents will limite the amount of content.


<h4 id="Objectives">Objectives</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a tank simulator</li>
        <li>Be as much immersive as possible, with a maximum of details</li>
        <li></li>
    <ul>


<h4 id="Scope">Scope</h4>

| In scope |
|---|
| Have a complete simulator |
| Most of the different parameters have been used, or all of them |
| Mutiple vehicles have been made, including the different type of vehicles (light, heavy, ...) |
| Graphics have to be advanced |

| Out of scope |
|---|
| Use classified documents |
| Do not work like a simulator |
| Use complete pre-made models/functions |
|  |

<h4 id="Principle">Principle</h4>
The goal of a simulator is to recreate as precisly as possible the reality. It means that the physic and the mechanics has the be very close to how it works in the reality.


<h4 id="Engine">Engine</h4>



<h4 id="Complexity">Complexity</h4>




<h3 id="2_Tanks">2) Tanks</h3>
Tanks are very complexe machines, and with a lot more technical specifications for the most modern vehicles than the first ones. Four main points have to be taken in account as shown here, but more technical specifications will be intergrated in the futur of the simulator.

<h4 id="Armor">Armor</h4>
Tanks are, for the most of them, equiped with a heavy armor. For the most modern the armor has different layers, which are not there for nothing, but can had 100mm of armor effectiveness just by adding a panel of 10mm. It will be a complexe part, because armor can redirect shells are just desintegrate the shell by taking in account the material used and other parameters.


<h4 id="Weight">Weight</h4>
Weight will not be a complex parameter to take into account, but its distribution will be important for the stability of the vehicles. Each armoured vehicles have different layout and so the stability is not the same.


<h4 id="Mobility">Mobility</h4>
For this to work, the weight, the engine power, the transmission, the sprockets and the tracks (or wheel for wheeled vehcicles) have to be taken in account. Those parameters are different for each vehicles because of the different material and layout used for each one


<h4 id="Firepower">Firepower</h4>
For the firepower, the type of cannon and shells used are the main parameters to take into account. Tho some tank uses autoloader and others use manual loader.


<h4 id="Others">Others</h4>
